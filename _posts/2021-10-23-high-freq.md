Tl;dr: Don't trust the noise performance of high-freq signal generators except at the signal frequency.

##### Background 

The large background current measured in our sample made me feel suspicious of the performance of the high frequency signal sources: HP 8753D Network Analyzer and E8257D PSG Analog Signal Generator, so I checked the frequency specturm of the source using an oscilliscope, and the result turned out to be very interesting ┑(￣Д ￣)┍   
  
###### Result 


The PSG frequency was set at 51.511MHz and -20 dbM, and the detected frequency peak include:  
-3dbM at 51.511MHz (expected)  
-30dbM at 1.511MHz
-35dbM at 11.36kHz
-50dbM at 60Hz
