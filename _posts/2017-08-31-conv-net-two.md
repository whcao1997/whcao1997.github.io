##### Convolutional Neural Network  

[Convolutional Neural Network](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/)  
Understand basic structures of convolutional neural network from stanford open-course. Pay special attention to the convolution layer's part, and understand the convolution operation from the gif given. You may refer back to this website for more careful lookthrough later.   
  
[A Beginner's Guide To Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner's-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/)  
This tutorial explains rather straightforwardly, with nice illustrations and examples. Combine with the last tutorial.  
[Handwritten Digit Recognition with a Back-Propagation Network ](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/293-handwritten-digit-recognition-with-a-back-propagation-network.pdf)  
One of the groundbreaking works in pattern recognition.  
  
###### Detailed Compositions  
[ReLU Layer - New Activation Functions ](https://github.com/Kulbear/deep-learning-nano-foundation/wiki/ReLU-and-Softmax-Activation-Functions)  
Take a look at the new ReLU activation function, compared with traditional sigmoid functions.  
[Pooling Layer](https://leonardoaraujosantos.gitbooks.io/artificial-inteligence/content/pooling_layer.html)  
Pay attention to how pooling layers are backpropagated.  
[Dropout Layer](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/JMLRdropout.pdf)  
Another commonly-used technique to prevent overfitting in neural networks.  

[Visualizing Convolution](https://leonardoaraujosantos.gitbooks.io/artificial-inteligence/content/pooling_layer.html)  
Watch the dynamic convolution illustration and several visualization of the function of individual layers.  
[Visualizing Convolution - YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/ghEmQSxT6tw)  
Visualize each convolution layers' function and how they form a hierarchical structure.  
[Tensorflow Realization](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers)  
This page tells how to realize CNN using tensorflow. The languages may be a little abstruse for newcomers, but at least better than nothing.  

##### General Deep Learning Strategies  
[Must Know Tips/Tricks in Deep Neural Networks](http://lamda.nju.edu.cn/weixs/project/CNNTricks/CNNTricks.html)  
The webpage shares some interesting insight into deep networks training.  
[How To Improve Deep Learning Performance](https://machinelearningmastery.com/improve-deep-learning-performance/)  
Some general discussion in sequential order.   

##### Object Detection
